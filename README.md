# My IP Address

This is a small SwiftUI app I did in a couple of days just to learn the basics of SwiftUI.

Don't throw me to the lions for any mistakes you see here, please.

## Setup

This was developed using macOS Monterey on an M1 Mac Mini, with Xcode 13 beta. This might not work on older setups, I haven't tried.

The code is supposed to run on iOS 14 and newer, though, so it should run on almost any modern iPhone.

## Feedback is welcome

If you're an experienced Swift developer and see anything smelly in this code, please don't hesitate to let me know and make a PR. We can all learn from everyone!
